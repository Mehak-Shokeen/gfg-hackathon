We have created Zensha a mental health sevice provider app through wix studio.
Zensha is a holistic mental wellness platform dedicated to empowering individuals towards balance, harmony, and serenity. Our name, inspired by Japanese concepts of 'zen' (balance) and 'sha' (protection), reflects our commitment to providing safe, supportive spaces for mental growth. Through expert guidance, personalized resources, and community connection, Zensha addresses anxiety, depression, trauma, and other mental health concerns. Our comprehensive approach integrates mindfulness, self-care, and evidence-based therapies to foster resilience and well-being.
